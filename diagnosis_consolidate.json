While the acetaminophen overdose is a primary concern for hepatocellular injury, the cholestatic features (elevated Alk Phos, jaundice, pruritus) suggest a component of cholestasis. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) can present with cholestatic patterns, and the recent history of high-dose acetaminophen use makes DILI a strong differential. The elevated bilirubin and itching are key indicators of impaired bile flow.",
